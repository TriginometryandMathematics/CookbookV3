	Ingredients
	<hr>
3/4 cup butter, softened
<hr>
2 cups sugar
<hr>
3 large eggs, room temperature
<hr>
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
<hr>
2 cups all-purpose flour
<hr>
3/4 cup baking cocoa
<hr>
1 teaspoon baking soda
<hr>
1/2 teaspoon salt
<hr>
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
<hr>
1-1/2 cups 2% milk
<hr>
chocolate frosting:
<hr>
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
<hr>
1/2 cup butter, cubed
<hr>
1 cup sour cream
<hr>
4-1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
<hr>
Chocolate curls, optional
<hr>

Directions
<hr>
Preheat oven to 350Â°. Line three 9-in. round baking pans with waxed paper; grease and flour the pans and paper.
In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy, 5-7 minutes. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Combine the flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt and baking powder; add to the creamed mixture alternately with milk, beating well after each addition.
<hr>
Transfer to prepared pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20-25 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely.
<hr>
For frosting, in a small heavy saucepan, melt chips and butter over low heat. Transfer to a large bowl; cool for 5 minutes. Stir in sour cream. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar until smooth. Spread between layers and over top and side of cake. If desired, top with chocolate curls. Refrigerate leftovers.
